# GUVI-internship Challenge
This Project covers all the requirements in this challenge.


### HOW TO SETUP THE PROJECT
Theis is a PHP project and will need an APACHE to run.
I recomment you use XAMMP. (You can use any other)
Step 1: Create a database in your PHPMYADMIN and name it "guvi" (You can use any prefered name and make the correct changes in the config/dbconfig.php file)
Step 2: import the sql file from config/database/. FILE_NAME: "guvi.sql"
Step 3: Place the Project folder in your root directory: (In the case of XAMPP, Place it in the "htdocs" directory)

You are all set, you can now run the app in your browser on localhost.
